					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know what has been happening in Syria for the last six years, but all we do is turn a blind eye to all the violence that is happening all around the world. How many of us actually know what the backstory of Syria is? What are they fighting for that could last more than six years? Why aren’t the most powerful countries in the world trying to end the war rather than ignite it more? And the most important question, how are people surviving in this land of war?</p>

							<p>In March 2011, a few teenagers were arrested and tortured for painting revolutionary slogans on a school wall. There was already an uprising against the government and this incident sparked a protest which was poorly handled by the government killing over a hundred Syrians. This resulted in the opponents turning to violence as well. There were rebel brigades trying to take control from the government which descended to a civil war. This was an advantage for the steady rising of the <abbr title="Islamic State of Iraq and Syria">ISIS</abbr> jihadist group as well. Right now, the civilians are trapped in a war between the government, the revolutionaries and <abbr title="Islamic State of Iraq and Syria">ISIS</abbr>. On top of this, the most powerful countries of the world are dropping missiles all over Syria.</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, we will only know how it feels like when it happens to us. Maybe then, we will help each other and forget our differences. Maybe then, we will unite and fight for those who cannot fight, protect those who cannot protect themselves and just maybe,save one or two lives.</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this country of hell, where people could turn to no one for support, a few
						    emerged to do the bravest thing what the world has refused to do - save Syrian lives. Every person in Syria is a hero.There are a lot of organisations in Syria, but the one that has got our attention - The White Helmets. They have volunteers from all walks of life - teachers, students, pharmacist, tailors,doctors,carpenters. Only amidst devastating circumstances, a light shines on the best of humanity.</p>

							<ul>
								<li>The white helmets, that later became SCD, emerged in late 2012.</li>
								<li>SCD has grown to be an organisation of more than 3000 volunteers operating from 111 local civil defence enters across 8 provincial directorates.( Aleppo, Idlib, Latakia, Hama, Homs, Damascus, Damascus Countryside and Daara).</li>
								<li>In October 2014, these self organised teams came together and formed the Syria Civil Defence (SCD).</li>
								<li>As of January 2017, SCD has claimed to have saved about 80,000 people since they began to keep count from 2014 from effects of civil war.</li>
								<li>The SCD was nominated for 2016 Nobel Peace Prize  and was a recipient of the 2016 Right Livelihood award,the alternative Nobel Prize.</li>
								<li>The White Helmet’s motto: “To save one life is to save all of humanity” - a phrase from the Koran.</li>
							</ul>

							<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though there are a lot of conspiracies around the White Helmet organisation, I believe that every individual who joined the organisation had only one goal in mind - to save lives. In my eyes, every Syrian is a hero. A hero we do not talk about or even acknowledge. The unsung heroes of Syria.  </p>
